# Incident Management System

## Core Features

### Incident Lifecycle

- **Creation** - Users can create new incidents with title, description, and priority
- **Assignment** - Incidents can be assigned to users (self-assignment or reassignment)
- **Status Management** - Toggle between OPEN and CLOSED states
- **Tracking** - Maintain creation and update timestamps

### Filtering and Pagination

- **Status Filter** - Filter by Open or Closed incidents
- **Assignment Filter** - Show unassigned, assigned to me, or assigned to others
- **Pagination** - Handle large datasets with proper pagination controls
- **Search** - Allow searching by title or description

### Table Display

Required columns for incident table:

- **Creation Date** - When the incident was first reported
- **Title** - Brief description of the incident
- **Status** - Current state (OPEN/CLOSED)
- **Assigned Person** - Who is responsible for the incident
- **Priority** - Urgency level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)

## Business Rules

### Assignment Logic

- Users can assign incidents to themselves
- Users can reassign incidents from others to themselves
- Unassigned incidents can be claimed by any user
- Assignment changes should be tracked with timestamps

### Status Management

- Only assigned users should be able to close incidents
- Reopening closed incidents should be allowed
- Status changes should update the `updatedAt` timestamp

### Priority System

- Use enum values: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
- Priority affects display order and filtering
- Critical incidents should be highlighted in the UI
